# üöö PICKUPLINK ‚Äì The Autonomous Truck Delivery Ecosystem

**Your Truck. Your Route. Your Earnings.**

PickupLink is the first fully autonomous, AI-driven delivery platform built exclusively for independent **TRUCK drivers** (pickup and light/medium-duty trucks like F-150, RAM, Tundra, Tacoma, Silverado, etc.). We operate on a zero-liability, 100% independent contractor model.

## üéØ Goal
To build and operate a globally scalable, self-financing delivery platform managed entirely by interconnected intelligent bots.

## ü§ñ Core Principles

* **100% Independent Driver Model:** Drivers use their own insured trucks.
* **Self-Financing:** Zero upfront investment; funded by a **20% (Standard) / 25% (Express)** platform fee from the first transaction.
* **100% Creator Ownership:** No company-owned trucks, no drivers on payroll.
* **Zero Liability:** Drivers provide their own insurance and registered vehicles.
* **AI-Driven Governance:** All operations (Dispatch, Marketing, Legal, Finance) are managed by autonomous bots.

## üíª System Architecture

The ecosystem runs on a modular microservices architecture, with each core bot functioning as an independent service:

1.  **Driver App/API:** Drivers register and verify their truck.
2.  **Client/Partner API:** Clients and logistics partners (Amazon, FedEx, etc.) submit delivery requests.
3.  **Dispatcher Bot:** Matches jobs to the most suitable nearby drivers using AI routing.
4.  **Finance Bot:** Calculates driver earnings and handles automated payouts (80% Driver / 20% PickupLink).
5.  **Governance Bot:** Oversees system balance, growth, and strategic expansion.

## üöÄ Expansion Roadmap

| Phase | Region | Focus |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **1** | Charlotte, NC | Local launch, Pickup Trucks only. |
| **2** | North Carolina | Statewide scaling. |
| **3** | United States | Nationwide, all light/medium trucks allowed. |
| **4** | International | Europe and LATAM expansion. |
| **5** | Partner Integration | Activate real API partnerships (Amazon, FedEx, UPS). |

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Instructions

* **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI/Flask (for bots), Open AI APIs, OpenRouteService.
* **Enforce Rule:** **TRUCKS ONLY.** Vehicle verification is paramount.
* **Modularity:** Use microservices for each bot and keep logic open for API integration.
